# Self Care Center Solo Challenge

Completed by: [Jim Charnesky](https://github.com/BigBike96/)

This is an app that gives the user an affirmation or a mantra depending on what is selected.
Before a user adds their own affirmation or mantra, all affirmations and mantras that can be
randomly selected are all material from the late great Mitch Headberg.
A user can select which type of message they would like to receive, and then click the Receive Message button.
A random message will appear. If the user clicks the Add Message button at the bottom of the screen,
two entry forms and a button will appear. This first entry is for what type the entry is.
The second box if for the users own message. After clicking Submit the users information will be stored and displayed.
